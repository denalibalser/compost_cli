# CompostCli

Hello! This is a CLI program meant to help you determine where the drop-off locations are located in the five boroughs of New York City. Composting is an easy way to reduce waste, however, living in a city it can be a difficult practice to navigate (you can't just throw your food scraps in your likely non-existent backyard after all). As such, the purpose of this program is to increase the simplicity and accessibility of urban composting in New York City.

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/compost_cli`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

ruby gem 'compost_cli'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
